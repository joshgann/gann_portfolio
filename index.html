            I would like to work for a media organization where I am able to use my writing, editing, shooting, and/or broadcasting skills. I have a passion for sports, and would love to, one day, work in the sports media field. Most importantly, however, I have developed a passion for journalism and reporting and want to exude this passion in my future career field.

            I am a currently a senior at Virginia Tech; I am majoring in Multimedia Journalism with a concentration in Sports Media and Analytics and minoring in Professional and Technical Writing. Through my education at Virginia Tech, I have become a diligent worker who strives to go beyond what is asked of me. I have developed skills in writing, shooting video, photography, editing video and audio, coding, and broadcast performance through my time in the Communications department at Virginia Tech.

          <p>
            I have been involved in the student-run newspaper at Virginia Tech - Collegiate Times - since my sophomore year of college. Collegiate Times has significantly enhanced my skills as not only a writer, but a reporter as well. You can read more about my experience in the <a href="writing.html">writing</a> section of my page.

            Throughout my four year as at Virginia Tech, I have also been very involved with Cru, a campus ministry. Within Cru I have had the joy of leading in various capacities, including:
            <ul>
              <li>Leading weekly Bible Study</li>
              <li>Mentoring younger students</li>
              <li>Leading World Team: raising awareness and funds for global issues</li>
            </ul>
